### What is HTML?

The full meaning of HTML is **_Hyper Text Transfer Protocol_**. HTML is a Markup language.  
HTML is used to buld the **_STRUCTURE_** of the web pages.

### HTML Basics

- **`<DOCTYPE html>`** is used to **tell** the browser, this is an HTML5 document.
- **`<html>`** is the **container** of all HTML elements. This tag is used to **indicate** the beginning and end of all HTML elements in an HTML Document.

- **`<head>`** element is used to give **browser and search engine** informations about the page.
- **`<title>`** element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar and in the page's tab).
- **`<body>`** element is the container for all the visible contents such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc in the webpage.
- The **`<em>`** element is used to define emphasized text. By default, emphasized text is
  displayed in _italic_.
- The **`<strong>`** element is used to represent important content. Browsers, by default, render strong content in **bold**.
- The **`<i>`** and **`<b>`** elements are considered deprecated because HTML should not be used for styling. That’s the role of CSS.
- Headings are represented using **`<h1>`**, **`<h2>`**, **`<h3>`**, **`<h4>`**, **`<h5>`**, **`<h6>`**. Every web page should have one and only one **`<h1>`** element. Headings should have a natural hierarchy and should not be skipped.
- Entities are used to display special characters such as angle brackets, copyright symbol, etc. The most important entities are: **`&nbsp;`** (non-breaking space), **`&lt;`** (less than sign), **`&gt;`** (greater than sign) and **`&copy;`** (copyright symbol).
- The **`<div>`** and **`<span>`** elements are generic containers used for styling purposes. Divs are block-level elements, spans are inline elements. A block-level element starts on a new line and takes up the entire available horizontal space.
- Semantic elements help us write markup that is more meaningful and descriptive to search engines, screen readers and other software. So, use **`<div>`** and **`<span>`** elements when no other semantic element is appropriate.
- The semantic elements in HTML5 are: **`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, `<time>` and `<mark>.`**

  **An Example of Basic HTML Boilerplate is**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta
      name="keywords"
      content="TravellerAlim, Alim, Travel, AlimTheTraveller"
    />
    <meta
      name="description"
      content="Alim is an passionate traveler who travels around the world and loves to make adventures"
    />
    <title>TravellerAlim</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```
